Panels, dialogs, and collapsible sections are disorienting when they appear instantly, so animation gives the eye something to follow. Toasts and notifications need just enough entrance to be noticed without startling. State changes like a switch flipping or a selection highlighting feel more intentional with a brief transition.',

            'When you do animate exit, match the entrance. A panel that slides in from the right should slide back out to the right.',
            'Direction should match the action. Navigating deeper into content should feel like moving forward. Going back should feel like returning. This keeps the user oriented in the structure of the application.',
            'Contextual UI should feel connected to its trigger. A dropdown should expand from the button that opened it. A popover should appear near the element it describes. This doesn\'t apply to global UI like command palettes or toasts, which have their own fixed positions.',
