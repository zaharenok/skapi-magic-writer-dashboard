/**
 * @file Shared test helper: build @astryxdesign/core once, race-free.
 *
 * `astryx theme build` imports the compiled @astryxdesign/core/theme entry
 * (there is no in-CLI fallback generator), so any test exercising it needs a
 * built core. The CI `test` job runs `pnpm test` without a prior core build,
 * and Vitest runs test files in parallel worker forks. When two build-theme
 * suites each ran `if (!exists) pnpm -F @astryxdesign/core build` in their own
 * beforeAll, both workers saw dist missing and launched concurrent builds that
 * collided on the shared packages/core/dist (core's build starts with
 * `rimraf dist`): one worker wiped dist while the other was mid-write, failing
 * nondeterministically ("Could not resolve dist/index.js" / "ENOTEMPTY rmdir
 * dist/hooks").
 *
 * This serializes the build behind a filesystem lock so exactly one worker
 * builds and the rest wait for it to finish before reading dist.
