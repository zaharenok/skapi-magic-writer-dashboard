/**
 * @file Regression test for `astryx init` "Next steps" theme guidance.
 *
 * The init command previously steered users toward the slower runtime
 * style-injection path:
 *
 *   import { neutralTheme } from '@astryxdesign/theme-neutral'
 *   <Theme theme={neutralTheme}>...</Theme>
 *
 * ...which contradicted the runtime console warning emitted by core's
 * <Theme> component (packages/core/src/theme/Theme.tsx) recommending the
 * pre-built path, and left users with an unstyled app because the base CSS
 * imports were never mentioned (facebook/astryx#3080).
 *
 * These assertions lock in the corrected guidance: base CSS imports, the
 * pre-built (`/built` + `theme.css`) theme path, and the custom-theme build
 * command.
