/**
 * @file Guards doc prop types against opaque named unions (#1645).
 * @input Every {Name}.doc.mjs plus the TypeScript sources they describe.
 * @output Fails when a documented prop type hides its legal literal values.
 * @position Repo-wide doc-shape guard, sibling of docPropReferences.test.ts.
 *
 * A prop type of `SpacingStep` or `TableSortState<TSortKey>` names a type
 * without revealing what may be written into it. Readers without an IDE —
 * agents especially — then guess: `gap={16}` (pixels, not a scale step),
 * `direction: 'desc'` (the type says `'descending'`). Both fail to compile.
 * `PropDoc.type` in docs-types.ts already asks for inlined unions
 * (`"'primary' | 'secondary' | 'ghost'"`); this test holds docs to it.
 *
 * Two ways a doc prop can hide values, checked at different strictness:
 *
 *   1. DIRECT — the prop type *is* (or contains) a literal-union type name.
 *      `gap: SpacingStep` must read `gap: 0 | 0.5 | 1 | …`. The name never
 *      buys the reader anything the literals don't, so inlining is required;
 *      prose is not an escape (see ENUMERATED_IN_PROSE for the one exception).
 *
 *   2. INDIRECT — the prop type names a composite whose own definition
 *      carries a literal union: `status: InputStatus` hides
 *      `'warning' | 'error' | 'success'`, `sort: TableSortState` hides
 *      `direction: 'ascending' | 'descending'`. Here the values may be
 *      surfaced in the type (spell the shape out — preferred when the object
 *      is small) *or* in the description, because forcing a twelve-field
 *      object into the type column would make the docs worse, not better.
 *
 * Both registries are derived from the TypeScript sources at test time, so a
 * new member on a union (or a renamed one) fails here until docs catch up.
